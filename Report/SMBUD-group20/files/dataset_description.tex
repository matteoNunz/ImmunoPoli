The dataset is drawn from a random generator. It allows enforcing parameters such as the number of visits, tests, covid vaccinations, families and the probability of being positive.
The generator sequentially builds the graph starting from people, places, families and groups of flatmates. \\
Families are groups of people with at most two different surnames that, whereas flatmates are combined randomly. \\
It adds all the vaccinations ensuring that the first dose of vaccine grants a one-month validity certification. Further vaccinations for each person provide one-year validity certification employing the same vaccine as the first one. \\
After the creation of all the principal entities, it builds instances of "visit"  relationships. \\
The last step consists in making the swabs. For all the swabs, the date is postponed to the dates of all the visits.
