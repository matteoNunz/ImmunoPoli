The project relies on the hypotheses described below:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item All information provided by people is truthful.
    \item Noone visits a place knowing that they have been tested positive.
    \item There is no limit for the number of vaccine doses injectable.
    \item The property \textit{app} in Person entity is a boolean attribute used to identify whether or not the person has any type of contact tracing application.
    \item The period ranging from virus incubation to test outcome acknowledgment is \textbf{seven days}.
    \item Every address is associated with just one house or public place.
    \item Deletion of information about contacts occurred more than ten days before the current date. They are useless because once a person is tested positive, we check their potential connections up to seven days before the test date. 
    \item The database includes only entries related to indoor places. Those are assumed to be accessible through a specific ticket/badge and a covid certificate vaccination scan. It is reasonable that once a certificate is scanned, all details are shared with our application to create an instance of \textit{visit} relationship.
    \item Since the \textit{infect} relationship represents a \textbf{covid exposure}, the actual contagion refers to a positive swab without a negative one after a fixed amount of time. 
\end{enumerate}
